Hello, these are my projects that were written while studying Dedinskyâ€™s course from the Department of Microprocessor Technologies in Intelligent Control Systems (MIPT, 2024, Huawei).

Each project provides assembly via "makefile".

Most files have the .cpp extension for convenience, **all projects are implemented in C**.

**In many tasks the architecture is not the best, perceive the tasks as an indicator of knowledge of the language mechanism**
